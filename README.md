# Time-Series-Modelling-with-prophet

This is an implementation of prophet on Binance Coin. This implementation focusses on why we should  NOT use prophet
for prediction of cryptocurrencies. 

Time series prediction of cryptocurrencies using prophet does not generate reliable results due to the heavy volatility of these coins
i.e. lack of weak and strong trends and patterns.
